## 📌 Problem Statement

Students, developers, and evaluators often struggle to quickly understand, analyze, and test problem-solving systems from raw repositories or vague problem descriptions. Manual evaluation is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks intelligent feedback.

This project addresses the need for an **automated intelligent system** that can:

* Accept project or problem inputs
* Clone and analyze repositories
* Use AI reasoning to process logic
* Present results through a clean frontend

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

This platform provides an end-to-end intelligent solution where users submit a GitHub repository or problem input. The system clones the repository, extracts relevant logic, sends structured prompts to an LLM, processes the response, and displays meaningful outputs on a web interface.

The solution combines **AI prompt engineering**, **backend automation**, and a **responsive frontend**, making problem analysis fast, interactive, and user-friendly.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

* React / Next.js
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS

**Backend:**

* Node.js
* Express.js

**AI / Logic:**

* LLM (Prompt-based reasoning)
* Custom prompt engineering

**Deployment & Tools:**

* Vercel (Frontend)
* GitHub
* Google Drive (Demo Video)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User submits a GitHub repository link or problem input
2. Backend clones and reads the repository
3. Relevant logic and context are extracted
4. Structured prompts are sent to the LLM
5. AI processes and generates intelligent analysis
6. Output is displayed on the frontend
